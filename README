pdgen - create puredata patches from haskell.
attempts type-safety.

things like `poly' have always annoyed me because you need to duplicate the same vox 8 times and connect it etc. attempt to fix that.

todo:
can connect PdSig into PdAny - should not be able to
Language.Pd.PdGen.Connectors needs some thought
want to be able to describe subpatches which are exactly the same each use & be output as separate files, perhaps cleaner
better output, and better graph layout
